		<div class="row">
			<h5 class="twelve columns">This program is presented in two parts. The first part is a progressive guide in the study of the guitar and the achievement of realistic goals. Organized practice helps acquiring a true perception of one’s abilities. To be effectual it must become a gratifying and productive experience. A systematic approach towards effective and productive practicing is presented and key points discussed. The second part covers the complex role of the Performer. Interpretive ability and artistic creativity, psychology, public relations and booking concerts are all skills the modern musician must posses for a successful career and are addressed in this presentation. Learning the method of performing, overcoming performance anxiety, preparing for concerts are also key points discussed. Developing an awareness of the value of good performance practices is a priceless tool for music students and a source as well as a foundation for further exploration and learning. </h5>

			<h1 class="twelve columns">The History of the Guitar</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<h5 class="twelve columns">This is a comprehensive and inspiring PowerPoint presentation on the history of the instrument. It covers 500 years in the rich evolution of one of the most versatile and diverse instruments of the stage. In a parade of visual examples, guitars and lutes from the Renaissance to the present will be displayed. Each musical period will be discussed individually and in comparison, from the composers that wrote for them and the players who mastered them to the makers who tailored them to the demands, aesthetics and needs of each era. I will also draw comparisons by examining key changes in guitar construction and looking at some instruments from the inside out to reveal the secrets of master luthiers. Recordings will provide examples of the sound of each instrument to complete the picture.</h5>
