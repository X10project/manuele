Organized practice helps acquiring a true perception of one’s abilities. To be effectual it must become a gratifying and productive experience.

			<h1 class="twelve columns">The History of the Guitar</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<h5 class="twelve columns">This is a comprehensive and inspiring PowerPoint presentation on the history of the instrument. It covers 500 years in the rich evolution of one of the most versatile and diverse instruments of the stage. In a parade of visual examples, guitars and lutes from the Renaissance to the present will be displayed. Each musical period will be discussed individually and in comparison, from the composers that wrote for them and the players who mastered them to the makers who tailored them to the demands, aesthetics and needs of each era. I will also draw comparisons by examining key changes in guitar construction and looking at some instruments from the inside out to reveal the secrets of master luthiers. Recordings will provide examples of the sound of each instrument to complete the picture.</h5>
